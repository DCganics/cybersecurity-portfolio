#About Me
Name: Diedra Cobb
Hometown: Urbana, IL, USA.
The IT field interests me because I love solving problems, and I love a good and healthy challenge. 
After completing this course, I'd like to get a Master's Degree in a related field or to get a great paying job that will allow me to have a healthy work/family balance. 
I am proud that I ran a home healthcare business for 4 years, where I incorporated holistic healing methods and traditional medical methods, in order to help my clients.
