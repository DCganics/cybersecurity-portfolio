#About Me
Diedra Cobb
Urbana, IL, USA
The IT field interests me because I love solving problems 
After completing this course, I'd like to get a Master's Degree in a related field or to get a great paying job that will allow me to have a healthy work and family balance 
I am proud of the way that I ran a home healthcare business for 4 years where I incorporated holistic healing methods in combination with traditional methods to help clients
