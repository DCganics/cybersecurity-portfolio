A portfolio for showcasing my progress and achievements in cybersecurity.
#About Me
Name: Diedra Cobb
Hometown: Urbana, IL, USA.
The IT field interests me because I love solving problems, and I love a good and healthy challenge. My experience in IT includes having worked with SAS, html, and Windows software.   
After completing this course, I'd like to get a Master's Degree in a related field or to get a great paying job that will allow me to have a healthy work/family balance. 
I am very proud that I ran a home healthcare business for 4 years, where I incorporated both holistic healing and traditional medical methods in order to help my clients.

Today we were introduced to all of the cybersecurity program staff, we received our laptop computers, we completed some documents online for Ms. Pope, we went over the history of Windows and how to get to the Run function for Linux, we used the Run function to set up a new account for ourselves on our laptops, we did a 2 lies and 1 truth about ourselves ice breaker, we took a tour of the City of Refuge campus, we were served both breakfast and lunch, and it was a great first day!
